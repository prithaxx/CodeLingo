# What is Codelingo
Codelingo is a learning app that uses a quiz-style approach to bring learners up to speed  quickly and succinctly, allowing users to master various programming languages. The app covers a wide range of language concepts, offers guided tours of documentation, and promotes good coding practices. It is designed to be accessible anywhere, allowing users to learn at their own pace and convenience. 
# Who is Codelingo for
Codelingo is designed for individuals of all skill levels, including both professionals and learners seeking to enhance their programming skills and become fluent in a chosen language.
# Why is Codelingo valuable
Codelingo provides several key benefits to its users. By offering a convenient and accessible platform for learning and reviewing programming languages, our app saves users time compared to traditional methods such as going through the documentations or searching up template files. The app improves code fluency and retention by allowing users to explore language nuances, practice coding, and discover common code patterns. Moreover, it fosters good coding habits for the selected languages and provides practical knowledge that can be immediately applied in programming projects.

# How will Codelingo be successful
We have established clear criteria to ensure and measure the success of our vision. We will be measuring the number of accounts joined through referral and through a comparative survey done by users who have finished a course in Codelingo, determining a preference either for our app or traditional documentation. As well as conduct a comparative study to evaluate the performance of participants who completed a Codelingo course versus those who relied solely on documentation. Measure their performance in a final quiz and retention of knowledge after a two-week period. We will also be conducting a journal study with participants who will be starting a new job in an unfamiliar language and compare their experiences to those who did not complete a Codelingo course for the new language. We will also conduct another journal study, gathering expert assessments from professionals who are experts with languages,  to evaluate the coverage of our courses.

Overall, Codelingo's vision is to provide a comprehensive and accessible tool for learning and reviewing programming languages. By empowering our users to become proficient in their chosen languages, Codelingo aims to save time, improve fluency and retention, foster good coding practices, and ultimately enhance the programming skills of its users.
