# Group 15: Code Linguists

## Purpose of the project

The purpose of the CodeLingo project is to accelerate learning and mastery of programming languages through a quiz-style app, making it easier for programmers at all levels to quickly become fluent in new languages. It aims to replace traditional, less efficient methods of study with a structured, engaging platform that improves code fluency, encourages consistent learning, and provides practical, applicable knowledge.

##  How to run
To find the most recent release of a stable version please go to the release page and download one of the APKs. If you wish to build from source you may clone one of the releases or you may clone the main repository into Android Studio. You can process the application by using the "Guest login" button. After that, the users are free to practice on varies programming questions.

# Iteration 0 Notes
- All features are issues with the label "Feature", all user stories are issues with the label "UserStory"
- The 5 User stories for iteration 1 are all marked as "high" with a label. We included future user stories to ensure the time estimates were consistent for grading.
- Developer tasks omitted from this iteration

# Iteration 1 Notes
- Time reporting is done on Issues labeled "DevTask"
- The focus of this iteration was to create a horizontal prototype, so we implemented a few features to a demonstrable state.

# Iteration 2 Notes
- Time reporting is done on Issues labeled "DevTask".
- This iteration had 2 sprints:
    + Sprint 1 focused on implementing the Demo Quiz and Course Navigation features.
    + Sprint 2 focused on integration testing and HSQLDB setup.
- In this iteration, we started 2 features: Demo Quiz and Course Navigation. These 2 features are mostly finished:
    + Demo Quiz : Still need to implement code block type quiz slide (low priority).
    + Course navigation: Still need to work on the design of the Chapter Summary popup modal (medium priority).
    + [These issues](https://code.cs.umanitoba.ca/comp3350-winter2024/codelinguists-ao1-15/-/issues/?sort=created_date&state=opened&milestone_title=Iteration%203%20-%20CodeLingo&or%5Blabel_name%5D%5B%5D=Sprint%201%20-%20Iteration%202&or%5Blabel_name%5D%5B%5D=Sprint%202%20-%20Iteration2&first_page_size=100) have been moved into the next iteration.
