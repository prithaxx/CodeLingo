# Summary Sentence

CodeLingo is a tool where learners and professionals can achieve fluency with unfamiliar programming languages quickly and efficiently.

# What is CodeLingo?

CodeLingo is a learning app that uses a quiz-style approach to learning language-specific details quickly and succinctly, allowing users to review and master the nuances of various programming languages. The app covers a wide range of language concepts, from basic syntax and best practices, all the way to more advanced syntax and language-specific design patterns, serving as a guided tour of documentation. Courses are broken down into bite-sized lessons, allowing users to learn at their own pace and convenience. 

# Who is CodeLingo for?

CodeLingo is designed for programmers, including both learners and professionals seeking to enhance their programming skills and become fluent and up to speed in a chosen language.

# Why is CodeLingo valuable?

CodeLingo provides several key benefits to its users. By offering a convenient and accessible platform for learning and reviewing programming languages, our app saves users time compared to traditional methods such as going through the documentation or searching for code examples. The app improves code fluency and retention by allowing users to explore language nuances, practice coding, and discover common code patterns. Moreover, it fosters good coding habits for the selected languages and provides practical knowledge that can be immediately applied in programming projects.

CodeLingo supports consistent learning habits by enabling users to maintain a daily streak through the timely completion of lessons. Additionally, CodeLingo incentivizes users by rewarding badges and certifications, fostering motivation for deeper engagement in their courses. These certifications not only signify achievement but also enhance users’ resumes.

# How will CodeLingo be successful

The success of CodeLingo will be measured across three criteria; users’ preferring CodeLingo over reading through documentation, language syntax is learned faster and is retained longer when learned through CodeLingo, and the content of every course is comprehensive.

First, we will be measuring preference by the number of accounts joined through referral and are aiming for 5% of referred accounts to complete at least 1 course.  
We will also be running a comparative survey done by users who have finished a course in CodeLingo to determine if users prefer our app or traditional documentation, aiming for a 70% preference over reading through documentation.  
Second, a controlled study will be run to evaluate the performance of two groups of participants completing a CodeLingo course versus reading documentation. We will measure their performance using a quiz and testing for retention of knowledge after a two-week period. We are aiming for an improvement of at least 20%.  
To test for the comprehensiveness of CodeLingo, we will be running a journal study with participants who will be starting a new job in an unfamiliar language and compare their experiences to those who did not complete a CodeLingo course for the new language.  
We will also be gathering the assessments from professionals and language specific experts, to evaluate the coverage of our courses and provide an assessment of comprehensiveness. We will consider this successful if the assessments indicate complete coverage.
