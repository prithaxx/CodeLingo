                    <h3>What is CodeLingo?</h3>
                    <p>CodeLingo is a learning app that uses a quiz-style approach to learning language-specific details quickly and succinctly, allowing users to review and master the nuances of various programming languages. The app covers a wide range of language concepts, from basic syntax and best practices all the way to more advanced syntax and language-specific design patterns, serving as a guided tour of documentation. Courses are broken down into bite-sized lessons, allowing users to learn at their own pace and convenience.Â

                    <h3>How will CodeLingo be Successful?</h3>
                    <p>The success of CodeLingo will be measured across three criteria; users prefer CodeLingo over reading through documentation, language syntax is learned faster and is retained longer when learned through CodeLingo, and the content of every course is comprehensive.
                        First, we will be measuring preference by the number of accounts joined through referral and are aiming for 5% of referred accounts to complete at least 1 course.
                        We'll conduct a user survey comparing CodeLingo with traditional documentation, aiming for a 70% preference for our app over traditional reading.

                    <h3>Why is CodeLingo valuable?</h3>
                    <p>CodeLingo provides several key benefits to its users. By offering a convenient and accessible platform for learning and reviewing programming languages, our app saves users time compared to traditional methods such as going through the documentation. The app improves code fluency and retention by allowing users to explore language nuances, practice coding, and discover common code patterns. Moreover, it fosters good coding habits for the selected languages and provides practical knowledge that can be immediately applied in programming projects.

                    <p>We'll conduct a controlled study comparing CodeLingo course completion to traditional documentation reading, measuring performance via quizzes and knowledge retention after two weeks, aiming for a 20% improvement. Additionally, a journal study will assess CodeLingo's comprehensiveness by comparing experiences of participants starting new jobs in unfamiliar languages, with and without CodeLingo training. Feedback from professionals and language experts will be gathered to evaluate course coverage. Success will be determined by assessments indicating comprehensive coverage.</p>
