                <h3>How did the project change from your initial (iteration 0) vision or stories, or did it work out as predicted?</h3>
                <p>The project itself didn’t change as it is still an app that teaches programming languages. We were able to finish the main features of the app, such as course selection/navigation, quizzes and feedback. There were some features from our original plan that we weren’t able to implement, such as notifications and mistake reviews. We also decided to cut down the time allocated for the design in the latter iteration, compared to the first iteration, for example: login/course selection is very pretty, quizzes less so.</p>
                <h3>What did you learn about team or large project development? What will you start doing, keep doing, or stop doing next time?</h3>
                <p>We learned to set up meetings and do planning together, which is very important throughout the project. This leads to better time allocation and work distribution between every member. We learned to use version control to coordinate and work together efficiently in all parts of the app, from UI and logic to persistence. We also learned that designing the interface before building the front end leads to unused and bizarre behaviour, while backend development being driven by the needs of the front end leads to organic and purer code. We will take these as valuable experiences and keep doing them in future projects.</p>
                <h3>What went right in the development process?</h3>
                <p>The team was able to work together, divide and complete tasks efficiently. We have meetings every week which shows good communication and planning for all four iterations. Everyone was able to make meaningful contributions to the final product.</p>
                <h3>What went wrong in the development process?</h3>
                <p>The team had some problems with time management, which led to the work getting pushed to the last minute very often.
                <br>We were also too ambitious in the beginning which led to cutting a lot of initial ideas down.</p>
                <h3>Also, ensure that you discuss the area you identified for improvement after your iteration 2 retrospective; how did it go?</h3>
                <p>In this iteration, we continue to improve our planning by splitting the tasks into 3 teams: The new feature team, the acceptance tests team and the website team. We still keep the same branching strategy, with 4 layers: Main, Development, Feature, DevTask and it has been effective. </p>
